# Eliminating biased word embedding associations

Many recent works have observed biases in word embeddings. [Caliskan et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.07187.pdf) proposed a methodological way of analyzing various biases through a series of Word Embedding Association Tests (WEATs). In this experiment, we show that replacing the metric on the word embedding space with a fair metric such as EXPLORE eliminates most biases in word embeddings.
