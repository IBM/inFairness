## Individual Fairness and inFairness

Intuitively, an individually fair Machine Learning (ML) model treats similar inputs similarly. Formally, the leading notion of individual fairness is metric fairness [(Dwork et al., 2011)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2090236.2090255); it requires:

$$ d_y (h(x_1), h(x_2)) \leq L d_x(x_1, x_2) \quad \forall \quad x_1, x_2 \in X $$

Here, $h: X \rightarrow Y$ is a ML model, where $X$ and $Y$ are input and output spaces; $d_x$ and $d_y$ are metrics on the input and output spaces, and $L \geq 0$ is a Lipchitz constant. This constrained optimization equation states that the distance between the model predictions for inputs $x_1$ and $x_2$ is upper-bounded by the fair distance between the inputs $x_1$ and $x_2$. Here, the fair metric $d_x$ encodes our intuition of which samples should be treated similarly by the ML model, and in designing so, we ensure that for input samples considered similar by the fair metric $d_x$, the model outputs will be similar as well.

inFairness is a PyTorch package that supports auditing, training, and post-processing ML models for individual fairness. At its core, the library implements the key components of individual fairness pipeline: $d_x$ - distance in the input space, $d_y$ - distance in the output space, and the learning algorithms to optimize for the equation above.

For an in-depth tutorial of Individual Fairness and the inFairness package, please watch this tutorial. Also, take a look at the [examples](./examples/) folder for illustrative use-cases. For more group fairness examples see [AIF360](https://aif360.mybluemix.net/).

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community in any form - whether it is through the contribution of a new fair algorithm, fair metric, a new use-case, or simply reporting an issue or enhancement in the package. To contribute code to the package, please follow the following steps:

1. Clone this git repository to your local system
2. Setup your system by installing dependencies as: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` and `pip3 install -r  build_requirements.txt`
3. Add your code contribution to the package. Please refer to the [`inFairness`](./inFairness) folder for an overview of the directory structure
4. Add appropriate unit tests in the [`tests`](./tests) folder
5. Once you are ready to commit code, check for the following:
   1. Coding style compliance using: `flake8 inFairness/`. This command will list all stylistic violations found in the code. Please try to fix as much as you can
   2. Ensure all the test cases pass using: `coverage run --source inFairness -m pytest tests/`. All unit tests need to pass to be able merge code in the package.
6. Finally, commit your code and raise a Pull Request.


## Tutorials

The [`examples`](./examples) folder contains tutorials from different fields illustrating how to use the package.

### Minimal example

First, you need to import the relevant packages

```
from inFairness import distances
from inFairness.fairalgo import SenSeI
```

The `inFairness.distances` module implements various distance metrics on the input and the output spaces, and the `inFairness.fairalgo` implements various individually fair learning algorithms with `SenSeI` being one particular algorithm.

Thereafter, we instantiate and fit the distance metrics on the training data, and 


```[python]
distance_x = distances.SVDSensitiveSubspaceDistance()
distance_y = distances.EuclideanDistance()

distance_x.fit(X_train=data, n_components=50)

# Finally instantiate the fair algorithm
fairalgo = SenSeI(network, distance_x, distance_y, lossfn, rho=1.0, eps=1e-3, lr=0.01, auditor_nsteps=100, auditor_lr=0.1)
```

Finally, you can train the `fairalgo` as you would train your standard PyTorch deep neural network:

```
fairalgo.train()

for epoch in range(EPOCHS):
    for x, y in train_dl:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        result = fairalgo(x, y)
        result.loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```
